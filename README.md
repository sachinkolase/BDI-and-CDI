# BDI-and-CDI
Brand development index and Category development index
The brand and category development indexes help identify strong and weak segments (usually, demographic or geographic) for particular brands or categories of goods and services.
For example, by monitoring the CDI (category development index), marketers might determine that Midwesterners buy twice as many country-western music CDs per capita as Americans in general, while consumers living on the East Coast buy less than the national average.
This would be useful information for targeting the launch campaign for a new country-western performer. 
Conversely, if managers found that a particular product had a low brand development index in a segment that carried a high CDI for its category, they might ask why that brand suffered relatively poor performance in such a promising segment.
Brand Development Index—BDI (I): An index of how well a brand performs within a given market group, relative to its performance in the market as a whole.

Brand Development Index––BDI (I) = [Brand Sales to Group (#)/Households in Group (#)]/[Total Brand Sales (#)/Total Household (#)]

Example: Oaties is a minor brand of breakfast cereal. Among households without children, its sales run one packet per week per 100 households. In the general population, Oaties' sales run one packet per week per 80 households. This translates to 1/100 of a packet per household in the childless segment, versus 1/80 of a packet in the general populace.

BDI = (Brand Sales/Household)/(Total Brand Sales/Household) = 1/100/1/80 = 0.8


Category Development Index—CDI: An index of how well a category performs within a given market segment, relative to its performance in the market as a whole.

Category Development Index (I) = [Category Sales to Group (#)/Households in Group (#)]/[Total Category Sales (#)/Total Household (#)]
